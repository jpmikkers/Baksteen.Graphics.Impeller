# Baksteen.Graphics.Impeller

This is a csharp demo project that uses Flutter's [Impeller](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/main/impeller/toolkit/interop/README.md) 2D render library and [DotGLFW](https://github.com/dcronqvist/DotGLFW). I also added a demo project that uses **Avalonia** and an Impeller control based on **Avalonia.OpenGL**. I havn't figured out yet how to enable MSAA (multisampling) for **Avalonia.OpenGL** so the rendering for the latter has jaggies.
